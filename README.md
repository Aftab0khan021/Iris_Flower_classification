## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains 150 rows of flower measurements:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## 📊 Objective

Build a model that accurately predicts the iris species using supervised learning techniques.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression

## 📈 Results

- Achieved up to **95% accuracy** using Support Vector Machine
- Performed cross-validation and compared models
- Used confusion matrix & accuracy score to evaluate performance
